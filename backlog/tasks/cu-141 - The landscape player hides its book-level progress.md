## Description

Found while verifying [[cu-19]] on the 800dp landscape tablet.

`binding.progress` — the book-level line, now `6h 12m left in book` — carries

```xml
android:visibility="@integer/currently_playing_artwork_visibility"
```

which `values-land/integers.xml` sets to `2` (GONE). So **the landscape player shows no
book-level progress at all**: the listener sees where they are in the *chapter* and what
percentage of the book is done, but never how much book is left.

Two things are tangled here and only one was fixed under cu-19:

- **Fixed in cu-19.** `renderPlayerText()` guarded on `binding.progress.isShown`, and since that
  view is permanently GONE in landscape the guard returned early *every* time — so the chapter
  position, chapter duration, percentage **and chapter title** were all blank too. The guard now
  anchors on `chapterProgressSeekbar`, which is present in both orientations.
- **Still open, this task.** The view itself remains hidden, and it is *text*, not artwork —
  sharing the artwork's visibility flag is simply wrong now. Unhiding it is not a one-line change:
  it is constrained to `details_artwork` (`layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf`,
  `layout_constraintRight_toRightOf`), which genuinely does not exist in landscape, so it needs a
  landscape constraint set of its own.

Deliberately out of cu-19's scope: that task's criterion is about the *format* of the readout, and
this is about the *layout* of one orientation. Filed rather than folded in so the layout work is
visible instead of hidden inside a formatting change.

## Also hidden: the chapter position line

`chapter_progress` (now `Ch 3 of 6`) **is written correctly** — the accessibility dump proves it,
reporting `text: Ch 1 of 10` on that view — but it lays out at **zero width**
(`boundsInParent: Rect(0, 0 - 0, 29)`) and never appears. It is constrained to
`chapter_progress_seekbar`, which the same dump reports as `visible: false` in this layout, so the
constraint resolves to nothing.

Note the diagnostic trap this cost: `uiautomator dump` **omits** a zero-bounds view from its tree
as an "invisible child", so the text reads as *missing* rather than as *present but unplaced* —
two very different bugs. The `AccessibilityNodeInfoDumper` lines in logcat show what the dump
dropped, and are the way to tell them apart.

So landscape is missing **two** of the four readout lines, both for layout reasons, both needing
the same landscape constraint set.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The book-level progress line is visible in the landscape player
- [ ] The chapter position line (`Ch 3 of 6`) lays out with real width in landscape
- [ ] `binding.progress` no longer keys its visibility off
      `currently_playing_artwork_visibility` — it is text, not artwork
- [ ] Verified on the 800dp landscape tablet **and** in portrait, since the constraint set differs
- [ ] `RawDurationFormatTest` still passes: the line must stay human-formatted when it appears

## Notes

While here, check the other views constrained to `details_artwork` for the same problem —
`progressPercentage` is constrained to it too and *does* render, so the constraint alone is not
fatal; it is the shared visibility integer that hides `progress`.
